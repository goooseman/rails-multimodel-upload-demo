# jQuery File Upload for Rails

[jQuery-File-Plugin](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload) is a file upload plugin written by [Sebastian Tschan](https://github.com/blueimp). jQuery File Upload features multiple file selection, drag&drop support, progress bars and preview images for jQuery. Supports cross-domain, chunked and resumable file uploads and client-side image resizing.

jquery-fileupload-rails is a library that integrates jQuery File Upload for Rails 3.1 Asset Pipeline (Rails 3.2 supported).

## Plugin versions

* jQuery File Upload User Interface Plugin 6.11
* jQuery File Upload Plugin 5.19.3
* jQuery UI Widget 1.9.1+amd

## Installing Gem

    gem "jquery-fileupload-rails"

## Using the javascripts

Require jquery-fileupload in your app/assets/application.js file.

    //= require jquery-fileupload

The snippet above will add the following js files to the mainfest file.

    //=require jquery-fileupload/vendor/jquery.ui.widget
    //=require jquery-fileupload/vendor/load-image
    //=require jquery-fileupload/vendor/canvas-to-blob
    //=require jquery-fileupload/vendor/tmpl
    //=require jquery-fileupload/jquery.iframe-transport
    //=require jquery-fileupload/jquery.fileupload
    //=require jquery-fileupload/jquery.fileupload-fp
    //=require jquery-fileupload/jquery.fileupload-ui
    //=require jquery-fileupload/locale

If you only need the basic files, just add the code below to your application.js file. [Basic setup guide](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Basic-plugin)

    //=require jquery-fileupload/basic

The basic setup only includes the following files:

    //=require jquery-fileupload/vendor/jquery.ui.widget
    //=require jquery-fileupload/jquery.iframe-transport
    //=require jquery-fileupload/jquery.fileupload

## Using the stylesheet

Require the stylesheet file to app/assets/stylesheets/application.css

    *= require jquery.fileupload-ui

## Using the middleware

The `jquery.iframe-transport` fallback transport has some special caveats regarding the response data type, http status, and character encodings. `jquery-fileupload-rails` includes a middleware that handles these inconsistencies seamlessly. If you decide to use it, create an initializer that adds the middleware to your application's middleware stack.

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use JQuery::FileUpload::Rails::Middleware

## [Example app](https://github.com/tors/jquery-fileupload-rails-paperclip-example)
This app uses paperclip and twitter-bootstrap-rails
